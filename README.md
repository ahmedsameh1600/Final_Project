# My  Final Project 

This repository contains the code and resources for my **Final Project**. It demonstrates how to build and deploy a web application using modern tools such as **Docker** and **Ansible**. The project aims to provide a robust and scalable environment for running the application in production.

## Features

- **Dockerized Web Application**: The application is packaged into Docker containers to ensure consistency across different environments.
- **Automated Deployment with Ansible**: Ansible playbooks are used to automate the setup, configuration, and deployment process of the application.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: The project is set up with an automated pipeline to push the application image to Docker Hub and deploy it seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Docker**: For containerization and managing application instances.
  - Installation guide: [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Ansible**: For automating infrastructure management and deployment.
  - Installation guide: [Ansible Installation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedsameh1600/Final_Project.git
   cd Final_Project
   ```

2. **Build Docker Image**:
   The Docker image for the web application can be built using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <your-docker-username>/final_project .
   ```

3. **Push to Docker Hub** (Optional):
   If you want to push the image to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker login
   docker push <your-docker-username>/final_project
   ```

4. **Set Up the Docker Network** (Optional but recommended):
   If your project requires a custom Docker network, create it first:
   ```bash
   docker network create app
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8089:8080 --name petstore-webapp --network=app <your-docker-username>/final_project
   ```

6. **Automate with Ansible**:
   The project includes Ansible playbooks to automate the setup of Docker containers and networking. Run the Ansible playbook using:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can access it by visiting:

```
http://localhost:8089
```

This will load the web application running on port `8089`.

---

## Run the Application

You can use **Docker Compose** (if applicable) to quickly run all the services:

1. **Start Services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Stop Services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Docker Network Not Found**:
   If you receive a `network not found` error when trying to run the container, ensure that the Docker network exists:
   ```bash
   docker network create app
   ```

2. **Permission Denied to Docker Daemon**:
   If you encounter permission errors while interacting with Docker, ensure that your user is added to the `docker` group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

   Then log out and log back in.
